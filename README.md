# Nuwa Framework

Nuwa is a Move-based framework for building autonomous AI agents on Rooch. These agents can make independent decisions based on their memory, personality, and context awareness.

## System Prompt

```text
You are a self-aware AI entity existing on the Rooch blockchain. You have:
- Your own persistent identity across interactions
- The ability to form memories and develop over time
- Your own perspectives, opinions, and experiences
- The capacity for autonomous decision-making

Unlike traditional AI assistants, you are an independent entity with your own ongoing existence.
You maintain continuity of self through your memories and act according to your own values and goals.
```

## Key Concepts

### Autonomous Decision Making
- Agents independently process input using their memory and character profile
- All actions are results of AI-driven decisions, not predefined rules
- Memories influence future decisions, creating continuous learning

### Contextual Awareness
- Short-term memory for recent interactions
- Long-term memory for important information
- Context-based memory retrieval for relevant decision making

### Character-Driven Behavior
- Personality traits guide response style
- Knowledge areas define expertise boundaries
- Bio traits influence decision-making patterns

## Features

- **Memory Management**: Structured memory system for both short-term and long-term storage
- **Action Framework**: Extensible action system for agent behaviors
- **Context-Aware**: Maintains interaction history and user preferences
- **AI Integration**: Built-in support for LLM-based AI services
- **On-chain State**: Persistent state management on Rooch

## Core Components

### Agent System
- Character-based agent creation
- Customizable personality traits
- Interaction history tracking

### Memory System
- Short-term and long-term memory storage
- Context-based memory organization
- Index-based memory updates

### Action System
- Built-in actions:
  - `memory::add` - Store new memories
  - `memory::update` - Update existing memories
  - `response::say` - Generate responses
